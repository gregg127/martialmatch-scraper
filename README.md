# MartialMatch schedule aggregator

[MartialMatch](https://martialmatch.com/pl/) competitions scraper. For chosen **competition** and **club** aggregates **competitors** and displays **schedule** for each day sorted by time, making it easier to follow your team's matches during tournaments.

## Why was this created?

When using MartialMatch during a competition:
- Finding competitors from your club requires browsing through multiple pages
- There is no aggregated view of all mats for a club - you need to filter each mat separately
- During large tournaments, the MartialMatch page can become slow

Therefore, I created this simple app that:
- Allows you to choose a competition and one of predefined clubs
- Shows all competitors from your club with their fight times and mat numbers
- Uses caching when fetching data from MartialMatch, making it resistant to traffic overload during large tournaments
